# ðŸ§¬ Virtual Creatures: Evolution Simulation

This project simulates a population of virtual creatures that evolve over time using neural networks and genetic algorithms. Tt visually demonstrates how artificial lifeforms can learn to move and adapt in a virtual environment.

Each creature is controlled by a simple neural network that takes in environmental inputs and outputs movement controls. Genetic algorithms are used to evolve the network weights over generations, allowing agents to improve their behavior based on a defined fitness function (e.g., distance traveled).
